          <span style={spanStyle}> 3.Donation Policies</span>
          <br />
          Tree adoption may involve a financial donation, which directly supports sustainable farming practices and
          environmental initiatives at Odelia Organic.

          <br />
          <span style={spanStyle}> 4.User Responsibilities</span>
          <br />
          Users are responsible for providing accurate and up-to-date information during the adoption process. Users
          must keep their account information confidential and report any unauthorised access promptly.

          <span style={spanStyle}> 5.Communication</span>
          <br />
          Adopters will receive periodic updates on the growth and well-being of their adopted trees via
          odeliaorganic.com or via email. For inquiries, users can contact our customer support team at
          odeliaorganic@gmail.com.

          <span style={spanStyle}> 6.Tree Care and Maintenance</span>
          <br />
          Adopters are encouraged to learn about sustainable farming practices and may receive information on how they
          can contribute to the well-being of their adopted trees. Any on-site participation in tree care events will be
          communicated to adopters in advance. If the tree is damaged or dies due to natural factors during the adoption
          period, Odelia Organic Farm will offer another tree as its replacement to complete the remaining period of
          adoption. If the adapter is not interested with the offer, the remaining adoption term will be cancelled. In
          this case, the remaining funds for tree adoption are not refundable.

          Organic Farm.
